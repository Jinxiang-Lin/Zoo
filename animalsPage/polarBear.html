            <img class = "animal-img" src="../img/polar_bear.jpg" alt="polar bear">
            <p>Polar bear is the largest bear in theirs bear family.
                They weighted between 900 to 1,600 pounds. They love to hunt seals.
                They rest silently by a seal's breathing hole
                in the ice. And then they wait for a seal to breath.
                Due to the climate change, ice melts early, and it's very difficult
                for polar bears to hunt and survive.
